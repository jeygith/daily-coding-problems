// Problem 63
//
// This problem was asked by Microsoft.
//
// Given a 2D matrix of characters and a target word, write a function that returns whether the word can be found in the matrix by going left-to-right, or up-to-down.
//
// For example, given the following matrix:
//
// [['F', 'A', 'C', 'I'],
//  ['O', 'B', 'Q', 'P'],
//  ['A', 'N', 'O', 'B'],
//  ['M', 'A', 'S', 'S']]
// and the target word 'FOAM', you should return true, since it's the leftmost column. Similarly, given the target word 'MASS', you should return true, since it's the last row.
//
// O(MN) Time complexity
// O(1) Space complexity
// M is number of rows in board and N is the number of columns in board
